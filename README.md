# Revv Cars web site (clone) 

**Revv Cars** is an Indian car-rental startup that offers multiple options to meet all your self-drive needs. The company was founded in 2015 and currently operates in 11 cities in India namely: Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, Mumbai, Pune, Delhi NCR, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Vizag, Mysore, and Coimbatore.

In this project we have tried to make a look alike clone of **Revv Cars**. With our efforts and the technology stack, that we have learned so far in the masai school, we were able to clone the front end with high precision and quality.

Let us share our experience,<br>
This entire journey of making the project was awesome. We have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence. there were some more functionalities that could have been done, the time didnâ€™t permit us to go further. But we will surely improve it during the course of time in future .
